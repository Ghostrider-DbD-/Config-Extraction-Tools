	GhostriderDBD' className extraction tool.
	=========================================

How To Use This Tool.

1) Start Arma 3 with any mods for which you wish to extract class names.
2) Start the Eden Editor.
3) Open the testConfig.Altis mission.

You are now ready to generate the class names. The tools copy these to the clipboard. All you need to do to generate a list of classnames is select the tool, Alt-Tab out of Arma, and paste the contents of the clipboard into a text editor such as notepad ++.
For each category (e.g., uniforms, weapons, vehicles) there are two tools. 
One generates a simple list of class names which could be used when configuring traders for Exile.
The second will generate a pre-configured price list using either Epoch or Exile formats.
You can determine which format of price list will be generated by changing DBD_priceConfiguration in init.sqf.
